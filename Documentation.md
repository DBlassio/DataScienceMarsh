** DO NOT RUN CODE LAST FOR 40MIN-1HR**


On this code we trained different machine learning models to predict the churn using the Telecom IBM Data. 
We started with an exploratory data analysis then we calibrate a KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM ann a ANN model. We made a benchmark and choose the one that best predicted.
The main objective is to find the best model among all, assuming the No Free Lunch Theorem.

Requirements: Python 3, Seaborn 0.11.2.

The Telecom Customer Data set consists of 22 columns and 5986 rows.
