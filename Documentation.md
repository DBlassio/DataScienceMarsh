** DO NOT RUN CODE LAST FOR 40MIN-1HR**


On this code we trained different machine learning models to predict the churn using the Telecom IBM Data. 
We started with an exploratory data analysis then we calibrate a KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM ann a ANN model. We made a benchmark and choose the one that best predicted.
The main objective is to find the best model among all, assuming the No Free Lunch Theorem.

The Telecom Customer Data set consists of 22 columns and 5986 rows.
